November 30, 2010




(10)	1. Declare a structure Student to represent information about a 
	   student: first name, last name, student number, grade (a real 
	   number)

#include <string>

struct student {
  std::string studentFirstName = "";
  std::string studentLastName= "";
  int studentNumber = 0;
  float grade = 0.0;
}


(10)	2. (a) We call a function with a single integer parameter. 
	       What will be passed to the function in a function call?
	   (b) Now we pass an integer array. What will be passed to 
	       the function in a function call?
	   (c) Now we pass a structure. What will be passed to the
	       function in a function call?

2a. void callfunction(int a)
2b. void callfunction(std::vector<int>& vec)
2c. void callfunction(struct structure)




(15)	3. void insert(int n, int a[n], int level, int v) is a function
	   that, given an integer array a with n positions of which the 
	   first level positions are occupied in sorted order, inserts v 
	   in a so that it remains sorted. 
	   
void insert(int n, int a[n], int level, int v) {
    // find the position to insert v
    int pos = level;
    while (pos < n && a[pos] < v) {
        pos++;
    }
    // shift the elements after pos to the right
    for (int i = n - 1; i > pos; i--) {
        a[i] = a[i - 1];
    }
    // insert v at the correct position
    a[pos] = v;
}
The function first finds the position to insert v by iterating over the sorted elements from index level to n-1.
It then shifts all elements after that position to the right by one index to make space for v.
Finally, it inserts v at the correct position. Note that the function assumes that the
first level elements of a are already sorted.
